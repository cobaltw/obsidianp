Mystery dungeons are strange, shifting labyrinths that are filled with mindless and aggressive Pokemon that attack on sight. They are entered through large portals leading to a space that is impossibly larger on the inside than it is on the outside, with a varying number of floors. It is unknown what causes mystery dungeons to appear.
Dungeons are extremely dangerous for those that are unprepared, and as such most Pokemon tend to avoid them entirely. 
## Temporary Dungeons
Rarely, portals will spontaneously appear in spaces where they never were. These lead to dungeons that vanish after a certain amount of time.
